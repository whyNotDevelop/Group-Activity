## ðŸ“– Overview

This Python script demonstrates **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm** to find the shortest path between two cities in a weighted graph. We use a greedy approach followed by a priority-queue implementation to compare results.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

1. **Step-by-step greedy approach**  
   - Manually tracks costs from source (`DBN`) â†’ destination (`JHB`).  
   - Shows intermediate calculations and chosen vertices.  

2. **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm implementation**  
   - Uses `heapq` for an efficient priority queue.  
   - Computes shortest distances to all nodes and reconstructs the optimal path.

3. **Graph Representation**  
   - Adjacency dictionary: `{ node: { neighbor: weight, â€¦ } }`.  
   - Easily extensible to more locations or different edge weights.
